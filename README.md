Hello, fellow adventurer, I would like to introduce you to MaslowGPT.

MaslowGPT is a command line NPM package that allows you to:

- [Ask questions to ChatGPT](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/ask_question/README.md)

- [Generate code in any existing programming language, using ChatGPT](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/generate_code/README.md)

- [Create Android/IOS applications using React Native](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/create_react_native_app/README.md)

- [Create TypeScript NPM packages](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/create_npm_package/README.md)

- [Create backend servers using Node.js (Express)](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/create_backend_server/README.md)

- [Do A.I. powered app internationalization](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/translate_strings/README.md)

and other things too (A.I. art, etc...) ;-) See the full list of features here

[All the MaslowGPT features](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/README.md#all-the-maslowgpt-commands)

[Here's a list of the apps and tools that MaslowGPT helped me create](#projects-created-with-the-help-of-maslowgpt)

You can access MaslowGPT via cmd, powershell and any other terminal known to mankind.

## Installation and initial setup üíΩ

Install MaslowGPT globally via NPM with the following command:

```
npm i -g maslow-gpt
```

If you encounter this error ```EACCES: Permission Denied``` while installing and/or using MaslowGPT, simply install ```NVM (Node Version Manager)``` , then rerun `npm i -g maslow-gpt` , and the issue will be fixed. 

NOTE: If you don't have Node.js installed on your computer, then installing NVM will also install Node.js , so installing NVM installs everything you need to use MaslowGPT ;-)

[NVM setup (select `nvm` on the dropdown menu of the install page)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)


I recommend setting up the ```Micro``` text editor as your default text editor within MaslowGPT. The default text editor used in MaslowGPT is notepad (on Windows) and Vim (on Linux/MacOS) , but those editors are not very fun to use, in my humble opinion ;-) So let's make our lives better, by installing Micro. It's very quick and simple ! Let's go:  

[Micro installation/setup for Windows users](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/TipsTricks/README.md#micro-editor-windows-10-setup)

[Micro installation/setup for Linux users](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/TipsTricks/README.md#micro-editor-linux-setup)

[Micro installation/setup for MacOS users](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/TipsTricks/README.md#micro-editor-macos-setup)

Once installed, start MaslowGPT using:

```
npx maslow 
```

If you're using MaslowGPT for the first time, and you don't have an API Key yet,
run the following command, to [subscribe to the API](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/subscribe/README.md) , in order to be able to use all the features
available in MaslowGPT ([ChatGPT chatting](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/ask_question/README.md), [code generation](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/generate_code/README.md), [A.I. art](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/generate_art/README.md) , etc...)

```
npx maslow subscribe
```

This command gives you a URL link to the API subscription page.

[More info about API subscription here](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/MaslowGPT/blob/main/AllReadmeFiles/subscribe/README.md)

The API access costs 15 USD (US Dollars)  This One Time Payment gives you access to an API key, plus 5000 API Credits.
The MaslowGPT API is usage based, so every time you make a request to MaslowGPT API, the associated cost is calculated, and your API Credit balance is used appropriately.

Your API Credit balance is available using the 

```
npx maslow get-api-client-info
``` 

command.

Once you purchased a MaslowGPT API subscription, the command below allows you to login to your MaslowGPT user account, via Google, so you can get your API Key loaded in MaslowGPT:

```
npx maslow login
```

Once you're logged in to your account, you're all set !
You're now ready to use all the powerful features of MaslowGPT.

When you have used all your initial API Credits, you can of course refill your API Credit Tank ;-)

To do so, use the following command: 

```
npx maslow buy-api-credits
``` 

to purchase 5000 API Credits, for 5 USD (US Dollars) 
to get back into your work !

More refill options will be added over time. 

#### Quick Note to the world: This is a work in progress, and also this is the beginning of my spiritual corporation üåû A worldwide company whose mission is to create a better education system. The poor quality of the current education system has taken a huge toll on my physical and mental health. To be honest, school literally almost killed me... This the reason why I want to create an ethical and spiritual enterprise that will make the world a measurably better place ! A place where the education system is doing it's job properly, A place that Abraham Maslow would be proud of ! So, I encourage you to subscribe to MaslowGPT. By doing so, you'll help yourself on your creative journey, and you'll help me build my ethical kingdom !!! Okay, enough pep talk. I'm a dreamer and an optimistic soul, and I want to provide value to the world üåû

#### One last note: I'm French, and I learned English through Youtube videos, and movies, so if you see some weird uses of the English language, or some typos, in this README documentation, keep in mind I'm doing the best I can, please forgive me for my grammatical sins ;-) üåû

## Projects created with the help of MaslowGPT

This tool helped me a lot when I created the following apps and plugins:

[GTA-3-VR](https://github.com/MaslowCorporation/GTA-3-VR)

[ArduinoGPT: Pre Release](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.arduinogpt)

You must subscribe to the [maslowcorporation Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/maslowcorporation) to be able to install the Pre Release version of the app.

An Android app that allows you to: 

- generate Arduino UNO programs from a text description of what you need (using ChatGPT) , 

- Install these programs on Arduino UNO devices, thanks to a QR code scanning mechanism built-in the app, and thanks to the companion app called `ArduinoHex`

- Share these programs with others thanks to a QR code scanning mechanism built-in the app

(An IOS version of this app is coming soon ;-)

[ArduinoHex: Pre Release](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.maslow.gpt.arduinogpt)

You must subscribe to the [maslowcorporation Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/maslowcorporation) to be able to install the Pre Release version of the app.

An Android app that ArduinoGPT needs, to install the Arduino programs on Arduino UNO devices, via USB/OTG

## Quick Note about Free features

Please note that you can still use MaslowGPT without subscribing to the API.

You will be able to use the free features available, like The React Native app generation, or the npm  package generation, etc....

And you'll get an error when you try to use the A.I. related stuff without an API Key ;-)

## Let's put all these shiny tools to work !!! Let's create an awesome and educational project üåû

Let's put this all together and show you the process of creating the following things:

- A sample Android/iOS app, 

I called my mobile app RemindMe,
This is a QNA app, powered with the magic of OPENAI.

- A backend server, 

I called my server maslow-gpt-api-v2.
This backend server powers the mobile app. This is also the same server that powers this MaslowGPT tool 

(of course I added tons of other stuff in my server, like function generators, etc... Just like you will add tons of stuff in your own server, for your own purposes. Remember, the whole process below serves as a guideline, for your own adventure.)

- A npm package, 

I called mine maslow-gpt-sdk.
This SDK is a convienient bridge between the server and the mobile app.

The following steps illustrate the whole process. 

The whole tutorial below serves as a guideline for you, adventurer ! You have a beautiful idea in your mind.
It could be anything, a cooking recipe app, the next Uber for your country where there is no Uber (Many places have no Uber or UberEats, so I just gave you ideas ;-), a fantastic educational app dedicated to help people climb their way up Maslow's hierarchy of needs...... the list goes on. 

Your bubbling/creative/restless mind is a powerful thing. ;-)

I want you to follow these steps, but don't forget that you're here to do your own thing, to create your own adventure.
So, in your adventure, the app that you're about to create is maybe called 'DingleDong' or 'Cookbook', and your server may be called 'CookbookAPI'..... You get it, CUSTOMIZE this thing, this is your own Frankenstein, this is your ride, so pimp your ride !!

So create what you want to create, based on the creation process app  described below. It's your adventure, you're the boss and the captain of the crew !!!

This app is destined to be available on both Android and IOS devices/emulators, but during the development
of this app, we'll focus on Android first. We'll worry about IOS later.

Please note that the UI of the websites in this tutorial, are subjected to changes, so if the tutorial pictures don't match whatever the new UI is at the time of you reading this, then use common sense, and find the corresponding thing on the new webpage UI, Don't worry, be smart, use your neurons, drink water ;-)

## 1) React Native Setup: Follow this guide to set up your development environment. More info here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup. üåû
