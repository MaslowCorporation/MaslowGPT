# generate-code

Allows you to generate computer code, based on your description (the code's language, logic, etc...) , using one of OpenAI's GPT models. 

This code is created in a folder/file specified by you. 

Let's go !

Run the 

```
npx maslow
``` 

command

<p align="center">

</p>

Choose ```generate-code```

</p>

You can also run the 

```
npx maslow generate-code
``` 

command

<p align="center">

</p>

Type the path of the folder where you want to create the generated code files. All the generated code files will be located within that folder.

</p>

Press <Enter> when prompted, to type a description of what you need.

Here, for example, I need a basic prompt mechanism that asks the user for it's name, then says Hello to this user. I want this code to be written in Javascript (Node.js). So I typed a description looking like this: 

```
Give me a Node.js program that asks the user for his/her name, then say hello in a warm and friendly way to this user.
```

</p>

When you're done describing your program, press ```F10```

Press ```Y``` , to save the code description.

</p>

Give a name and a file extension for the generated code file. In this example, I want to generated javascript code, so I called my code file ```HelloWorldPrompt.js```. I give the code file a ```.js``` extension.
If you generate Python code, you would give a ```.py``` extension. Got it ? ;-)

The code will be generated piece by piece, sit back and enjoy the show !

Once the code is successfully generated, a happy message will show up on screen.

You can check that the folder has been created.

</p>

The code folder contains several files:

- HelloWorldPrompt.js (or whatever other file name you gave to your code). This file contains the generated code.

- code_fix.txt, the file that allows you to make fixes on the generated code, via the ```make-code-fix``` and ```regen-ai-code``` commands.

- answer.txt, the file that contains the raw answer generated by OpenAI. The code piece is extracted from that file, thanks to the formatting of OpenAI's answers, that typically adds the code pieces within triple quotes.

- Maslow.json, the file that contains some metadata that allows code-regeneration, and prompt history. (DON'T TOUCH THIS FILE !!)

</p>

You can then use this code !!! In my case, it's a simple program that can be executed using the ```node path/to/js_file.js``` command

Here's what the code looks like, in my case.

Bravo ! You generated your first piece of code using MaslowGPT !

Thank you for being here. I believe in you.
